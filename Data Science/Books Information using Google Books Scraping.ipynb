Necaise introduces the basic array structure and explores the fundamentals of implementing and using multi-dimensional arrays. The underlying mechanisms of many of Python’s built-in data structures and constructs are covered. A number of ADTs and applications are discussed as threads throughout the book to allow for multiple implementations as new data structures are introduced. Real-world applications of the various chapter topics are also presented. This gives programmers complete coverage of abstraction and the basic data structures and algorithms in the Python language.Source: Publisher\n",

Today, electronic documents are enabling paperless reading supported by eReading technologies such as Kindles and Nooks, yet a high proportion of users still opt to print on paper before reading.
